An object is an instance of a class created from it using the new keyword. Once you create an object of a class, using it you can access he members of the class. In the below given code an object of the class Student is created.

The objects are created in the heap area and, the reference obj just points out to the object of the Student class in the heap, i.e. it just holds the memory address of the object (in the heap).

And since the String is also an object, under name, a reference points out to the actual String value (“Krishna”).
In short, object is an instance of a class and reference (variable) points out to the object created in the heap area.
